# CFENet_Cascaded-Feature-Enhancement-Network

Code for our article (High-Low Level Features Enhancement with Improved Attention Method for Medical Image Segmentation)
This paper proposes a Low-level Feature Enhancement Module (LFH), a High-level Feature Enhancement Module (HFE) and a Cascaded
Feature Enhancement Network. We evaluated our CFENet and proposed modules on three challenging datasets of skin lesion segmentation in
dermoscopic images, segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance (MR) images and 3D VBs segmentation.

# skin lesion segmentation
The skin lesion data set can be downloaded from ISIC.
The ISIC 2017 challenge dataset contains a total of 2,750 dermoscopy images, of which 2,000 were used for training, 150 were used for validation and the last 600 were used for testing.
Our experimental results are shown in the table below.
